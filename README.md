# Go(tta) have Secure Coding

A short talk about some of Go's advantages (and issues)

## Brief description

This talk in meant to introduce Go to an audience that may have never used the language.
As such, the first section mainly goes over some of the languages general concepts,
as well as why these concepts may help lessen some classes of programming bugs
(specially in comparison to C).

The second section shows a few situations that would usually be seem as good practice
(e.g., using `defer` to close a file),
but that may have corner cases that can end up causing bugs.

The slides assumes that Go's playground is accessible (and that the links are still working),
but they were also saved locally to [examples](examples/).
